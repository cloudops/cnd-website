                The event will discuss a variety of Cloud Native solutions and 
                CNCF member projects. Talks will be highly-technical and will 
                explore use cases, journeys, and demos that help developers use

            <h3>Who is this event for?</h3>
            <p>
                This event is both for beginners interested in starting their 
                Cloud Native journey as well as early adopters who wish to dig 
                deeper into the projects they have been interacting with for 
                years.
                
                Following the recent KubeCon+CloudNativeCon in Seattle, this 
                day-long event will capstone the Kubernetes and Cloud Native 
                meetups that have grown and evolved in Eastern Canada over the
                course of three years.
