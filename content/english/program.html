                    <p>
                        We will also demonstrate all the steps taken: from the creation of a new API project to deploying in
                        production, including monitoring and logging.

          <h5 class="conference-name">Using Rook to Manage Kubernetes Storage with Ceph</h5>
                <p class="conference-description">
                    This presentation will introduce the Rook project within CNCF and set the context around the problem
                    that it addresses. Through the use of the operator pattern, the Rook operator will be discussed to
                    understand how a storage cluster can be configured and managed through it. Rook started with Ceph as its
                    only storage backend but over the course of its development, many new backends have been introduced. For
                    the purpose of this presentation, the focus will be on the Ceph backend and how Rook makes it easy to
                    upgrade the operator and the backend independently of each other to give administrators control over
                    their environment. The use cases for Rook-Ceph will vary depending on the Kubernetes cluster and its
                    purpose. However, as end users of Rook-Ceph, the shared filesystem that Ceph provides allows for the
                    scalability of different services by running multiple pods with the same mounting point. If there's no
                    need for Read Write Many capabilities, Rook-Ceph also provides block and/or object storage interfaces to
                    pods. By the time of the presentation, Rook 1.0 would have been released and with it comes the Ceph CSI
                    driver implementation which will also be highlighted. Finally, a running Rook-Ceph cluster will be shown
                    and the Ceph cluster will be upgraded to a new release to pick up fixes and new features demonstrating
                    independence between the operator and its storage backends.

           <h5 class="conference-name">What is cloud native anyway</h5>
                <p class="conference-description">
                    Cloud Native and microservices architectures are growing in popularity every day, but once you start
                    writing production systems, how do you make sure they are fully tested? This session will give an
                    overview of the trials and tribulations when testing cloud native applications, drawing on our
                    experiences from writing the text-based microservice adventure Game On! and developing the polyglot
                    microservice system that generates code for IBM Cloud users. Starting from the ground up, it will cover
                    how to structure your application, the different types of tests you should write and how to test a
                    system of microservices when working across different teams. Finally, it will introduce code examples of
                    how to utilise tools such as JMockit to create mock objects that can be used during testing.

                    lurk within</h5>
                <div class="conference-description">
                    <p>
                        The abstraction layers of 'container' and 'helm' etc often make people not think about the security
                        issues. I run 'helm install X' or 'docker build'. That in turn imports many things which get
                        delivered
                        into my environment.

                    <p>
                        Containers are not a (strong) security barrier. We often think about security as a Boolean (outside
                        bad,
                        inside good). Here I will talk about 'Defense in Depth': assuming that bad things are already in,
                        and
                        the steps we take to harden the environment.

                        I will focus on Kubernetes environment, contrasting Helm (+Tiller) versus Kustomize, but this is
                        applicable to other environments.

                <p class="conference-description">
                    Over the past 500 years, there have been 16 cases of a rising power threatening to displace a ruling
                    power. 75% of those cases resulted in war. Although your organizational transformation probably won’t
                    lead to war, it could be contentious. History can help prevent conflict when driving change. This talk
                    will analyze human tendencies, historical data, and provide real-world examples of how to avoid conflict
                    during your DevOps journey.

         <h5 class="conference-name">Streams must flow: developing fault-tolerant stream processing application with Kafka Streams and Kubernetes.</h5>
                <p class="conference-description">
                    All things change constantly, and we need to get on board with streams! Moreover, dealing with constantly changing data at low latency is pretty hard. It doesn’t need to be that way. Kafka Streams, Apache Kafka’s stream processing library, allows developers to build sophisticated stateful stream processing applications which you can deploy in an environment of your choice. Kafka Streams is not only scalable but fully elastic allowing for dynamic scale-in and scale-out as the library handles state migration transparently in the background. By running Kafka Streams applications on Kubernetes, you can use Kubernetes powerful control plane to standardize and simplify the application management—from deployment to dynamic scaling. In this talk, Viktor explains the essentials of dynamic scaling and state migration in Kafka Streams. You will see a live demo of how a Kafka Streams application can run in a Docker container and the dynamic scaling of an application running in Kubernetes.

                        Furthermore, deployments have evolved from isolated Kubernetes islands towards interconnected services that also encompass public cloud services. We will share a few emerging patterns learned from operationalizing this spanning Kubernetes, Istio Citadel, Envoy and Calico.
