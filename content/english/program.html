            <h5 class="conference-name">The Basics of Open Source Licensing and Its Impact on the Cloud</h5>
            <div class="conference-description">
                <p>
                    In 1998 the Open Source movement was born as a business-friendly evolution and sibling of Free
                    Software.
                    Since that day, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has come to dominate the software world.
                    Nowhere is this more true than in cloud technologies.
                    If you list ten cloud technologies that you use today, chances are very good that each one of them
                    is
                    available under some sort of open source license.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite this prevalence, surprisingly few cloud software practitioners understand the meaning of
                    FOSS,
                    its licensing, or why its so important not only to cloud technologies but also to the businesses
                    that
                    use them.
                </p>

                <p>In this talk, you'll learn:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The definition of "open source" (yes, there actually is one)</li>
                    <li>The basics of copyright and licensing</li>
                    <li>How licensing impacts cloud and other software development</li>
                    <li>How you can use FOSS to encourage more innovation and adoption of your cloud native software

            <h5 class="conference-name">Using Rook to Manage Kubernetes Storage with Ceph</h5>
            <p class="conference-description">
                This presentation will introduce the Rook project within CNCF and set the context around the problem
                that it addresses. Through the use of the operator pattern, the Rook operator will be discussed to
                understand how a storage cluster can be configured and managed through it. Rook started with Ceph as its
                only storage backend but over the course of its development, many new backends have been introduced. For
                the purpose of this presentation, the focus will be on the Ceph backend and how Rook makes it easy to
                upgrade the operator and the backend independently of each other to give administrators control over
                their environment. The use cases for Rook-Ceph will vary depending on the Kubernetes cluster and its
                purpose. However, as end users of Rook-Ceph, the shared filesystem that Ceph provides allows for the
                scalability of different services by running multiple pods with the same mounting point. If there's no
                need for Read Write Many capabilities, Rook-Ceph also provides block and/or object storage interfaces to
                pods. By the time of the presentation, Rook 1.0 would have been released and with it comes the Ceph CSI
                driver implementation which will also be highlighted. Finally, a running Rook-Ceph cluster will be shown
                and the Ceph cluster will be upgraded to a new release to pick up fixes and new features demonstrating
                independence between the operator and its storage backends.

            <h5 class="conference-name">What is cloud native anyway</h5>
            <p class="conference-description">
                Cloud Native and microservices architectures are growing in popularity every day, but once you start
                writing production systems, how do you make sure they are fully tested? This session will give an
                overview of the trials and tribulations when testing cloud native applications, drawing on our
                experiences from writing the text-based microservice adventure Game On! and developing the polyglot
                microservice system that generates code for IBM Cloud users. Starting from the ground up, it will cover
                how to structure your application, the different types of tests you should write and how to test a
                system of microservices when working across different teams. Finally, it will introduce code examples of
                how to utilise tools such as JMockit to create mock objects that can be used during testing.

            <h5 class="conference-name">Defense in Depth: Securing your new Kubernete cluster from the challenges that
                lurk within</h5>
            <div class="conference-description">
                <p>
                    The abstraction layers of 'container' and 'helm' etc often make people not think about the security
                    issues. I run 'helm install X' or 'docker build'. That in turn imports many things which get
                    delivered
                    into my environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Containers are not a (strong) security barrier. We often think about security as a Boolean (outside
                    bad,
                    inside good). Here I will talk about 'Defense in Depth': assuming that bad things are already in,
                    and
                    the steps we take to harden the environment.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>service mesh</li>
                    <li>logging</li>
                    <li>network policy</li>
                    <li>reduction in privilege (de-root, de-privilege)</li>
                    <li>rbac, roles</li>
                    <li>understanding the upstream risk, quantifying, controlling</li>

                    <li>distroless</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    And I'll show a simple check list of activities you can do during your DevOps cycle that won't
                    change
                    your cost (much).
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will focus on Kubernetes environment, contrasting Helm (+Tiller) versus Kustomize, but this is
                    applicable to other environments.

            <h5 class="conference-name">DevOps is Not War</h5>
            <p class="conference-description">
                Over the past 500 years, there have been 16 cases of a rising power threatening to displace a ruling
                power. 75% of those cases resulted in war. Although your organizational transformation probably won’t
                lead to war, it could be contentious. History can help prevent conflict when driving change. This talk
                will analyze human tendencies, historical data, and provide real-world examples of how to avoid conflict
                during your DevOps journey.

            <h5 class="conference-name">Kafka on Kubernetes: Does it really have to be “The Hard Way”?</h5>
            <p class="conference-description">
                When it comes to choosing a distributed streaming platform for real-time data pipelines, everyone knows
                the answer: Apache Kafka! And when it comes to deploying applications at scale without needing to
                integrate different pieces of infrastructure yourself, the answer nowadays is increasingly Kubernetes.
                However, with all great things, the devil is truly in the details. While Kubernetes does provide all the
                building blocks that are needed, a lot of thought is required to truly create an enterprise-grade Kafka
                platform that can be used in production. In this technical deep dive, Viktor will go through challenges
                and pitfalls of managing Kafka on Kubernetes as well as the goals and lessons learned from the
                development of the Confluent Operator for Kubernetes.
